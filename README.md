# Description: 
> Short project description. 

In this project a pair of eyes appear at the center of the webpage. The eyes will track your mouse pointer as you move it across the webpage. Your mouse pointer must be inside the webpage area to be detected by the tracking eyes. Try it out for yourself and have fun!

# Installation:

If you want to test this project you will to download the .html, .js, and .css files to your computer. Make sure the three files are located in the same folder.

# Usage:

Once you finish downloaded all the project files, you only need to click on the .html file and start moving your mouse pointer across the webpage.
